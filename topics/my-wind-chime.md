A upcycled wind chime made from plastics discs and lid of cola container.


## {{ site.why }}

The inspiration for this project came from my office pantry... yup you read it right... the pantry! 

 > Inspiration can come from anywhere. You just need to keep your eyes and mind open to different possibilities. 
 
Every day, the pantry staff would load those huge bottled water containers on to the water cooler. Before loading, they would break open the seal, which was a white plastic round disc, the size of a 2 rupee coin. During a day, several such containers were used. This resulted in at least 4-5 plastic discs ending up in the sink, only to be thrown later in the trash bin. 

I couldn't help notice their unique shape and thought about what these might be used for. One day I collected (rather smuggled when no one was looking) some discs, washed them thoroughly, and took them home. I arranged them in different shapes, examined their thickness, tried poking holes in them, and painting them. 

Next day, I requested the pantry staff to keep some plastic discs aside for me. He gave me a puzzling look and nodded. By the end of 2-3 weeks, I had collected some 50 odd discs. The lid of a takeaway cola container ordered with burgers at a team lunch was just the missing piece I was looking for! 

## {{ site.what }}

 - Plastic discs from bottled water containers
 - Lid of a takeaway cola container

Apart from these, I used the following things readily available at home: 

 - Cotton thread
 - Acrylic paint
 - Needle and candle
 - Fevicol
 - Metal paper clip bent into a hook
 
## {{ site.how }}

The lid of the container serves as the top portion from which the discs can hang down on threads. Here's how I made it. 

 1. Heat the needle on a candle flame and make holes at equal intervals on the rim of the lid.
 1. In the same way, make a hole to the top of the plastic discs.
 1. Cut threads of different lenghts as per the design you want to create.
 1. Pass one end of the thread through the hole in the plastic disc and tie a small knot.
 1. Pass the other end through the hole in the lid and tie a small knot.
 1. Secure the knots using a small drop of fevicol so that the knots harden and do not become loose.
 1. Make two small holes at the center of the lid and pass the metal paper clip hook through them. You can then tie a thread to the hook to suspend the wind chime.
 1. Paint the lid and the discs using acrylic paints with the color of your choice. You can also paint the threads to coordinate with the colors of your lid and discs.
 > Tip: You can rest the lid on top of a bottle while painting so that the discs do not sway and stick to each other. You can leave it overnight to dry.

And that's it! You have a brand new wind chime, upcycled without much cost, made from materials that end up in trash.
