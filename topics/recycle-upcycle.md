| Recycling | Upcycling |
|---------|---------|
| Recycling is turning waste to reusable materials. | Upcycling is using or modifying the same material for a different purpose. |
| Items like paper, glass, metal, and plastics can be recycled to make other items of the same material. | Items like cloth, paper, glass, metal, and plastics can be upcycled.
| For example, recycled paper, recycled plastic packaging | For example, decorating an empty wine bottle and adding a string of rice lights to use it as a night stand lamp. |
| Recycling requires a lot of water and energy to clean, breakdown and convert materials. | Upcycling does not require as much resources as recycling. |
| Recycling is usually done at specialized facilities. | Upcycling can be easily done at home also. |
