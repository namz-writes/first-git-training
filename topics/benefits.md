 - __Environment friendly:__ Upcycling does not require much energy and water, unlike recycling which requires these resources to clean and breakdown materials. 
 - __Thrifty lifestyle:__ Upcycling encourages a thrifty lifestyle, as you can make things from waste yourself, instead of buying them at a hig cost from stores. 
 - __Creativity:__ Upcycling nurtures a creative approach of perseiving things. It gives things a second life and saves them from eding up in landfills.

As you upcycle things, you start identifing the wasteful practices and one-time use materials that come into your house daily. It also makes you conscious about your buying behavior and preferences.
