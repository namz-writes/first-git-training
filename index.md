# Upcycle Now and How

Hi, I'm {{ page.author }} and I've created this space to promote the idea of upcycling and showcase my upcycling projects.

Since many years, I've been following this mantra: 

> _Reduce, Reuse, Recycle_

In 2020, I added another verse to it - Upcycle.

> _Reduce, Reuse, Recycle, **Upcycle**_

## What is Upcycling?

Upcycling is the creative process of transforming old, broken, unused, or discarded materials into useful and beautiful things with more value or higher quality.

It's like giving a new twist of life to old things.
